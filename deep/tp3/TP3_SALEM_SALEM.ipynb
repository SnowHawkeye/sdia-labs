        "In these practicals, we will create a first convolutional neural network (CNN). This type of networks mostly rely on alternating layers of convolution and pooling. A convolution layer is a signal processing inspired layer that performs a bunch of convolutions on the layer input and yields filtered outputs known as feature maps. A pooling layer is a sort of subsampling layer. Most of the time, after several Conv/Pool layer pairs, an MLP is plugged to obtain class membership probabilities. When the number of layers is rather high (unclear how high this is), we obtain a deep network.\n",
